## üì¶ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd portfolio
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:
```bash
# Email Configuration for Contact Form
EMAIL_USER=your-gmail@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-gmail-app-password
```

**Note**: For the contact form to work, you need to:
- Use a Gmail account (easier setup than Outlook)
- Generate an app password from your Google account settings
- Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials

4. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## ‚ö° Performance Optimizations

### Time Optimization
- **Lazy Loading**: Heavy components loaded on demand
- **Memoization**: React.memo and useCallback to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Throttled Events**: Scroll and mouse events optimized with requestAnimationFrame
- **Reduced Animation Complexity**: Simplified GSAP animations for better performance
- **Frame Rate Limiting**: 3D scenes limited to 30 FPS for better battery life

### Space Optimization
- **Code Splitting**: Automatic code splitting with Next.js
- **Image Optimization**: Lazy loading and optimized image formats
- **Bundle Analysis**: Removed unused dependencies and imports
- **Conditional Rendering**: Heavy effects only on desktop devices
- **Efficient Data Structures**: Optimized component props and state

### Memory Management
- **Proper Cleanup**: Event listeners and animations properly disposed
- **Reference Management**: Careful handling of refs and DOM elements
- **Animation Disposal**: GSAP timelines and ScrollTriggers properly killed
- **Three.js Cleanup**: Geometries, materials, and renderers properly disposed

## üé® Customization

### Personal Information
Update the data in `src/app/page.tsx`:
- Projects array with your data engineering projects
- Skills categories with your technical expertise
- Contact information

### Styling
- **Colors**: Modify the color scheme in Tailwind classes and CSS variables
- **Animations**: Customize GSAP animations in component files
- **Layout**: Adjust spacing and grid layouts as needed

### Adding Projects
Add new projects to the projects array:
```typescript
{
  title: "Your Data Project",
  description: "Project description highlighting data engineering aspects",
  tech: ["Apache Spark", "Kafka", "AWS", "Python"],
  image: "project-image-url.jpg",
  liveUrl: "https://your-demo.com",
  githubUrl: "https://github.com/your-username/project"
}
```

## üìß Contact Form

The contact form includes:
- **Form Validation**: Client-side validation for required fields and email format
- **Email Integration**: Uses Nodemailer with Zoho SMTP for reliable email delivery
- **Success/Error Handling**: Clear feedback messages for form submission status
- **Security**: Environment variables for sensitive email credentials
- **Accessibility**: Proper form labels and ARIA attributes

### Email Configuration
The contact form uses Gmail SMTP for sending emails:
